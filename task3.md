Aspects of Teamwork:
In your discussions, think about the following aspects of your teamwork:
Mission Statement 
Ignite6 is a diverse team of global leaders united by a shared commitment to transformation. Our mission is to fuel ideas, spark meaningful change, and apply the knowledge and tools of Stanford LEAD to drive innovation and positive impact within our lives, organizations, industries, and communities around the world.
Vision Statement
To become an inner circle of catalysts - a trusted community of leaders who inspire each other and Stanford LEADers, challenge business status quo assumptions, innovate and co-create solutions that shape the future of businesses and society across sectors and geographies.

Timeline - What is the deliverable deadline? What milestones may be needed along the way to keep the team accountable to that final deadline? Is everyone available during each stage of the project?
We are setting a team goal(s), to submit our assignments, 12 - 24 hours before the deadline.
We will define an out-line for each assignment to discuss the main ideas and address: data/information, tasks, analysis, assessments and conclusions - if apply- to prepare a high level executive summary, detailed analysis and exhibits   
We will set prework meetings if needed to discuss the assignments.
Monica will schedule Google/Zoom calendar reminders to ensure team members complete prework where appropriate 
Team members to discuss level of prework (facts and backgrounds, data > information) needed based on assignment requirements 
We will use placeholders on our calendars to have reminders on the submissions.

Mode of Communication - How will the team communicate? What technologies are the teammates comfortable using and accessible?
We set a WhatApp group to communicate instantly as a team.
For all the assignments, we will have to start brainstorming (defining an out-line) at google docs and continue with the business/sector backgrounds, data/information, and analysis to discuss the case insights and conclusions and recommendations.
Zoom/Google platforms  for team collaborative meetings.
Defining PST timezone to agree on deliverables, check points and team feedback.

Roles - Who will do what pieces of the work or how will everyone work together throughout? Who will submit the final deliverable?
We will all do collaborative work since we have a diverse background.
Depending on the assignments each member can collaborate considering experiences and knowledge. 
Rotate submits according to team member professional/academic expertise or time schedules. 
Patricia will submit for Financial Innovation, Gaurav for Analytical Thinking.  Jaime will provide presentation templates. 

Diversity - What unique skills and perspectives does each team member bring to this particular project? How will you make sure to incorporate those throughout?
To ensure a diverse inclusion of skills, we will identify through extensive analysis made on our profiles our complementary abilities and respect diverse cognitive approaches.
We will create an environment where every unique expertise is not only respected but is required for project success.
Shared Strengths Across the Group
Technical Excellence and AI Leadership: Four members work at leading technology companies with deep AI/ML expertise (Google GenAI, Apple chips, Dell AI platforms, plus Citi's AI transformation)
Financial and Strategic Rigor: Multiple members bring quantitative analysis skills spanning M&A ($7B+ deals), risk management, portfolio optimization, and regulatory compliance
Senior Leadership Experience: All members hold VP+ or equivalent roles, bringing understanding of organizational change and scaling innovation at enterprise levels
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Each member's role requires managing complex stakeholder relationships across technical, business, and regulatory domains
Stanford LEAD Shared Foundation: All five are simultaneously developing innovation frameworks and leadership capabilities through the same program
Key Complementary Differences
Industry Diversity: Technology innovation cultures (Google, Apple, Dell) balanced with regulated industries (Citi) and emerging sectors (renewable energy)
Functional Expertise Spectrum: Digital transformation, hardware design, AI product strategy, M&A execution, and risk management create comprehensive innovation coverage
Innovation vs. Risk Perspective: Strong innovation capabilities (Monica, Gaurava, Frank) balanced by sophisticated risk assessment (Patricia, Frank's FDIC background, Jaime's due diligence)
Geographic and Cultural Reach: US domestic markets, LATAM expansion experience, Asian market connections, and international M&A expertise
Technology Maturity Range: Cutting-edge innovation (Apple/Google) to enterprise adoption (Dell) to regulated implementation (Citi)
Concrete Collaboration Opportunities
1. AI Transformation Risk Assessment Framework Combine Frank's AI product strategy, Patricia's risk management, and Jaime's M&A due diligence to create frameworks for evaluating AI investments. Monica's Google transformation experience and Gaurava's hardware insights provide technical validation of feasibility and scalability.
2. Cross-Industry Innovation Case Studies Leverage the team's diverse industry experience to develop innovation playbooks. Example: How can Gaurava's Apple chip innovation principles inform Patricia's banking technology adoption, with Jaime providing investment evaluation frameworks?
3. Global Market Entry Strategy Development Use Jaime's LATAM M&A experience, Patricia's Asian market connections, and Monica's international project management to create frameworks for technology companies entering new markets, with Frank and Gaurava providing technical feasibility assessments.

Team Accountability - How will the team make sure that everyone contributes and the deliverable gets submitted on time? 
We are defining rules of play as a team to set expectations clearly.
General Rules: Add your work/comments well in time so the final draft can be ready in the agreed timeline committed above. To present/add/ append something start a new paragraph and use your initials at the start of  your comment. Don’t remove anyone else’s work on shared doc. 
Governance/Quorum: 4 of 6 Stanford LEAD team members to define outlines, resources and data/information, check points, analysis and executive summary and detailed assignment information to be delivered.
Conflicts : Comments entered after the timeline window may not be added in the final solution. Team members must leverage data-driven analysis to understand and articulate conflicting points of view, ensuring robust debate. After the designated forum has finalized a decision, all involved are required to practice the principle of 'disagree and commit': respectfully integrating the final solution into their work and actively supporting its execution, even if their personal view was not adopted.
Keep a Positive Team’s Morale: we will be making sure as a team every voice is heard, and we will leverage each individual contribution and turn diverse perspectives into a strong collective outcome.


Additional Notes
Patricia will submit for Financial Innovation, Gaurav for Analytical Thinking.  Jaime will provide presentation templates. 

How can we leverage the unique perspectives of the group and ensure our end product represents all of us? One way I think will be critical is giving each other equal voice - making sure any one voice isn’t overbearing.
