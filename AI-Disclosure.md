Here's a clear and honest disclosure about the AI assistance used in creating your infographic:

## AI Disclosure for Stanford LEAD Assignment

**AI Tools Used:**
- **HTML/CSS Scaffolding**: AI was used to generate the initial HTML structure and CSS styling for the infographic layout, creating a professional template with responsive design and Stanford-appropriate color scheme.

- **Python Conversion Script**: AI assisted in creating a Python script using Selenium and Pillow libraries to automatically convert the HTML infographic into high-quality PNG and JPEG image formats for submission.

**Collaborative Team Process:**
The content and information in this infographic was developed through extensive team collaboration:

1. **Team Planning Sessions**: Our Ignite6 team held multiple collaborative meetings via Zoom/Google platforms to discuss our working arrangements, mission, vision, and operational guidelines.

2. **Collective Decision-Making**: We used our established governance structure (4 of 6 members required for decisions) to reach consensus on:
   - Mission and vision statements
   - Timeline commitments and submission goals
   - Communication protocols (WhatsApp, Google Docs, Zoom)
   - Role assignments and submission rotation
   - Team accountability measures and conflict resolution

3. **Documented Collaboration**: All team discussions and decisions were documented in our shared Google Docs workspace, with team members contributing their expertise and perspectives.

4. **Content Integration**: The AI-generated HTML template was then populated with our collaboratively developed content from our task3.md document, ensuring all information reflects our team's actual agreements and working arrangements.

**Final Product**: The infographic represents our team's genuine collaborative work, presented in a professional format created with AI assistance for technical implementation. The substance, decisions, and content are entirely the product of our team's collaborative process and Stanford LEAD learning.

This approach demonstrates responsible AI use where the technology assisted with formatting and technical implementation while the core content and decisions remained authentically collaborative and team-driven.
